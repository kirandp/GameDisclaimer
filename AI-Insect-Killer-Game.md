## 🎮 Gameplay Tips

### Positioning

1. **Stand at the Right Distance**: 
   - Follow the distance indicator on screen
   - Too close or too far affects gesture detection
   - Aim for the "✅ OK" status

2. **Clear Play Area**:
   - Ensure you have space to move your arms
   - Remove obstacles that might cause accidents
   - Be aware of your surroundings

### Gesture Tips

1. **Clapping**:
   - Clap with both hands in view of the camera
   - Works best when insects are falling in the center area
   - Quick, sharp claps work better than slow ones

2. **Punching**:
   - Punch toward the screen (camera direction)
   - Use your left or right hand - both work
   - Quick, decisive punches are more reliable
   - Aim your wrist near the insect to kill it

3. **Timing**:
   - Each gesture has a 500ms cooldown to prevent multiple detections
   - Wait a moment between gestures for best results
   - Watch for insects falling and time your gestures

### Strategy

1. **Insect Types Matter**: Higher point insects appear in later levels
2. **Target Multiple Insects**: Some gestures can hit multiple insects if they're close together
3. **Balance Claps and Punches**: 
   - Use claps for clusters of insects
   - Use punches for precise targeting
